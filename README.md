Why I Created This Project

Practice and Learning: I created this login form to improve my skills in front-end web development, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Working on this project helped me understand how to structure forms, style them responsively, and implement client-side validation using JavaScript.

Portfolio Project: This project serves as part of my web development portfolio. It demonstrates my ability to build modern and functional user interfaces, which is essential for web development jobs and freelance projects.

Reusable Component: I wanted to create a simple, reusable login form template that can be easily integrated into future web projects, such as personal websites, web apps, or client projects.

Foundation for Authentication: This form is a starting point for understanding how login systems work in websites. It can be expanded in the future to include integration with backend services like APIs, databases, or OAuth for full authentication functionality.
